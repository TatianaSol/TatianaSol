Hi! My name is Tatiana and I live in Novosibirsk, Russia. I work at MKK Strana Express, a debt collection agency, but want to start a carreer in IT.

I attended Higher College of Informatics in Novosibirsk, but then decided to continue my education at Novosibirsk State University of Economics and Management. 
From 2014 to 2021 I worked at Brusnika Property Management company and started my carreer at MKK Strana Express in 2021. 
Also in 2021 I completed QA course at Center of Financial Technologies and currently waiting to start my new carreer in IT. 
I learn Python in my free time and recently decided to try Kotlin.
